# Gini Android App

The Gini Android App is a sleek and efficient mobile application designed to showcase the latest in Android development practices. With its robust architecture and modern libraries, the app ensures a smooth and seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Retrofit Integration**: Utilizes Retrofit for network calls to fetch up-to-date data from the server.
- **Local Persistence with Room**: Saves and manages data locally using the Room database to ensure quick and reliable data access.
- **Proper Flow and Data Display**: Upon launch, the app presents a list of data retrieved from the local database. It then proceeds to fetch updates from the server, ensuring that the local database is synchronized with the latest information.
- **Live Data Updates**: The UI is built to observe changes in the local database and refreshes to display the most current data to the user.
- **Selective Display Logic**: Emphasizes content quality by displaying images that have accrued more than 50 comments and 50 likes, sorting them in descending order based on the like count.
- **Coil for Images**: Implements the Coil library for smooth and efficient image loading and rendering.
- **Dagger-Hilt for Dependency Injection**: Uses Dagger-Hilt to manage dependencies, providing a scalable and maintainable codebase.
- **Room Database**: Leverages the Room library for robust database management and seamless data handling.
